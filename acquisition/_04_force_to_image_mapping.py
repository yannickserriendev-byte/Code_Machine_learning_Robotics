"""
Force-to-Image Mapping Module for Acquisition Pipeline

This module synchronizes force measurements with image frames for machine learning datasets.
The main challenge is that force sensors (1000+ Hz) and cameras (10-50 Hz) operate at 
different frequencies, so we need to match each image to its corresponding force measurement.

Key functions:
    - create_location_image_loss_file(): Diagnostic mapping to identify lost frames
    - create_final_mapping_file(): Final synchronized dataset for ML training

Example workflow:
    1. After acquisition, you have separate image and force data
    2. Use create_final_mapping_file() to create one CSV with each row containing:
       [Image_Number, Image_Timestamp, Force_Timestamp, Fx, Fy, Fz, Mx, My, Mz]
    3. This CSV becomes your ground-truth dataset for machine learning

File structure context:
    This assumes your data is in: Code_Machine_learning_Robotics/[your_trial_folder]/
    With subfolders: Images/ (contains image_1.tiff, image_2.tiff, ...)
                    Results/ (contains CSV files with force and timestamp data)

    Create a diagnostic CSV to analyze image loss and frame-force timing alignment.
    
    This function helps identify which frames were lost during acquisition and how
    well the image timestamps align with force measurements. Use this to debug
    acquisition timing issues before creating the final dataset.

    Create the final synchronized dataset mapping each image to its force measurement.
    
    This is the main function for creating machine learning datasets. It takes all the

    that were captured before force measurements started, and renumbers remaining
    images sequentially.
